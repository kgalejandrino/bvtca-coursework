<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## User Stories

The Login box must be centered in the screen and stay in the center of the screen even as you resize the web-browser.  
This should be relatively easily acomplished with flexbox.  
The login box should have a minimum size, and the input fields or text in the box should not leak out of the box.  
The login box should have box-shadow and rounded edges.  
The login box should have a username and password input field  
If you can, please make sure text entered into the password field is hidden (with asterisks or circles)  
The login box should have a button  
You may experiment with colors if you would like, feel free to use the color palletes generator.  
You may experiment with additional features/styles, but if you do please make separate files for those experiments, thank you.  
Additional things you are welcome to experiment with:  
-Other Designs for Logins  
-Pictures as backgrounds or part of the Login UI  
-Adding additional features to the login
