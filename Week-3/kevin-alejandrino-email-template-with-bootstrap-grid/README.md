## User Stories

Create an Email Template using the attatched photo as a reference.  
Please Use the Bootstrap Library and the Bootstrap Grid System.  
The point of this assignment is not just to make an HTML Template, but to practice utilizing bootstrap   grid. Bootstrap grid is just a system of pre-written classes and media querries. Bootstrap grid utilizes   the functionality of the CSS Flexbox Module.  

Your project does not have to be a perfect recreation, but you should try to get it to closely resemble the picture.  

Your template should have 3 sections like the reference photo. The page should take the full windows's view, and there shouldn't be any margin on the sides of the window (use container-fluid instead of container)  

You will want to make sure to design the template so that the different sections of the page display   differently and clearly when the viewport is resized.  
You can easily acomplish this with Bootstrap Grid's column classes.  

Please refer to the bootstrap documentation, look at the examples they provide, and create your own files   for experimenting with bootstrap grid if you are confused.  
Spending time writing code and experimenting with what works will help you learn and understand what is   going on much better than trying to understand what to do on the first try.
